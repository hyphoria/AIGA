        		<hr>
    			<p>This conference seeks to activate three conversational platforms 
    			embedded in the conference title: <br /><br />
    			
    			<strong>1)</strong> Design Education as <em>Interface</em> ; <br />
    			<strong>2)</strong> Design Education as <em>Diverse Cultural and Social Space</em> and <br />
    			<strong>3)</strong> Design Education as <em>Politics.</em> <br /><br />
    			The conference will explore the idea 
    			that graphic design education is rapidly evolving: the social spaces we 
    			work in, and the practices of teaching and learning we engage with, are 
    			themselves mediated by larger contexts of social, cultural, political 
    			and technological change. Mindful of these changing contexts our 
    			conference will seek to pose questions about the assumptions we make about 
    			the relationship between making design, thinking about design, asking 
    			questions about design and theorizing design in as open and potentially 
    			interdisciplinary a framework as possible. We will also address how, 
    			as a specific discipline of making, we are uniquely placed to explore 
    			the limits of the emerging conversation about visual communication and 
    			visual culture in contemporary spaces of learning.</p>

        		<h3>Inside/Outside: Design Education as Interface </h3>
        		
        		<p>
        		Contemporary design education makes complex demands on educators to be 
        		both futurists and subject-matter experts. From both inside and outside 
        		of professional and disciplinary spaces, educators are tasked with identifying 
        		and articulating new interfaces of learning to prepare future designers for yet 
        		to be defined roles. Concurrently, students are navigating between alternative
        		 positions of user/outside and maker/inside of new, unfamiliar spaces of graphic 
        		 design practice. Graphic design education is being challenged at unprecedented 
        		 levels to address the continued technological and pedagogical shifting of new 
        		 platforms and processes. 
        		 </p>
        		 
        		<p>
        		For design educators some questions might follow from this: What is an interface? 
        		What is the range of subjective interface experiences open to teachers, students 
        		and designers? How does graphic design education understand changing notions of time, 
        		space, embodiment, sense, movement, attention, vision and desire? As technologies 
        		rapidly evolve, how does designing for and in unfamiliar spaces impact graphic design 
        		education? What new pedagogies are needed to match contemporary circumstances? 
        		What has to be given up as the curriculum expands? How can design education lead 
        		industry through thought and practice as opposed to creating a new generation of 
        		production workers? How can critical pedagogies confront seductive trends and enrich 
        		the disciplinary objectives of established learning spaces? In what way do graphic 
        		design curricula respond to designing for the new and the unfamiliar and how does 
        		this unfamiliarity impact the roles of the design educator and student?
        		</p>
        		
        		<p>
        		We invite your comments, questions and paper and panel proposals and workshop 
        		proposals as we continue to shape a conversation about ‘inside/outside’ design 
        		education as interface.

        		<hr>
        		
        		<h3>Inside/Outside: Design Education as Diverse Cultural<br /> and Social Space</h3>
        		
        		<p>
        		 As many introductory textbooks on anthropology, sociology, media studies, 
        		 communications studies, cultural studies or visual culture will tell us, 
        		 ‘culture’ is one of the most contested words in the English language. 
        		 Indeed, we use the word culture in a variety of often inconsistent ways 
        		 in our daily speech: to use the term culture is, alternately, an attempt 
        		 to represent ‘ethnicity’ or ‘race’ or community or language or ‘high culture’ 
        		 or ‘art’ and the complex intersections between these phenomena. 
        		 When we are in those spaces where culture is constructed — the design 
        		 education classroom is our primary space — we are also in spaces where 
        		 ideas and projections of Self and Other are constructed, contested and negotiated.
        		</p>
        		
        		<p>
        		For design educators some questions might follow from this: How can we engage 
        		with our students’ encounters with visual, popular and other forms of cultural 
        		experience in order to cultivate a deeper sense of curiosity, interest and 
        		engagement in the larger design process? What does the discourse of ‘culture’ 
        		mean to our students and how can we critically engage with and unpack those 
        		meanings? What is the role of voice and story in the process of interculturality 
        		and hybridity? How might the experience of being ‘hyphenated’ add to the 
        		exploration of story for design students and teachers alike? How do we engage 
        		with these stories?
				</p>
        		
        		<p>
        		We invite your comments, questions and paper and panel proposals and workshop 
        		proposals as we continue to shape our programming conversation about ‘inside/outside’ 
        		design education as diverse cultural and social space.

        	 	<h3>Inside/Outside: Design Education as Political Space</h3>
					
				<p>
				No doubt design education is a political and contested space. Design 
				programs everywhere are involved in discussions about their relevance 
				and the nature of it in rapidly changing socio-economic contexts. More 
				intimately within these spaces, design educators and students are interacting 
				within paradigms of gender, race, class, sexuality, dis/ability and other 
				factors that influence power dynamics. Then, as resources shrink, the need 
				to activate real democratic processes in increasingly diverse classrooms 
				expands; as the expectation of meeting the neo-liberal ideal of 
				student-as-worker-bee consensus widens, the possibility of supporting 
				the contestation that democracy requires narrows.
				</p>
				
				<p>
        	 	For design educators some questions might follow from this: Who is the Insider 
        	 	in graphic design education? Who is the Outsider? What are the ethical and pedagogical 
        	 	spaces between Insider and Outsider? What are the larger political macro-forces 
        	 	shaping our micro-experiences in design education and how do we address those 
        	 	forces? Is it the job of design-educators-as-Insiders to convert students to 
        	 	be Insiders, too? How do design educators negotiate the liminal terrains of 
        	 	the industry (not fully inside or fully outside) and of the academy 
        	 	(not always fully inside or fully outside)? How do our non-design academic 
        	 	colleagues and our non-academic design colleagues perceive what we do? 
        	 	How might understanding these perceptions help us prepare students for the 
        	 	difficult movement between Inside and Outside, between Insider and Outsider?
